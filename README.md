A wizardry website build with MeteorJS. This code might be useful if you want to have an example of MeteorJS file structure.

It uses ES6, Stylus, Jade, ThreeJS, TAPi18n, MomentJS and IronRouter.

Current tasks, bugs, etc. can be seen [on Trello](https://trello.com/b/D5IOdhwX/cbrwizard-com).

## How to dev:
```bash
meteor
```

## Tests
Tests are located in /tests and are written in Jasmine. They are quite general at the moment.
To run them, type

```bash
meteor --test
```

## Why

Why Meteor? Why Angular?

Have you ever made a technology choice which you later regretted? Well, I did a year ago. Now I understand that using Meteor and Angular for a static website was a really bad idea. I don't want to rewrite it now because rewriting is a waste of time. Well, you've got to learn something somehow!

## TODO
* Switch to static.

## Thank you

Suggestions are welcome! I hope that somebody finds this code useful.
